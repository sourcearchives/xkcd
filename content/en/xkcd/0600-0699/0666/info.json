I've made a set of silent tools.\nGuy: Why?\nHammer: <<whoosh whoosh whoosh>>\n\nHat Guy: Stealth carpentry. Breaking into a house at night and moving windows, adjusting walls, etc.\n[[He takes his silent hammer over to a tool bench with other things on it. Two boxes underneath are labeled \"Drills\" and \"Non-Drills.\"]]\n\nHat Guy, narrating: After a week or so of questioning his own sanity, the owner will stay up to watch the house at night. I'll make scratching noises in the walls, pipe in knockout gas, move him up to his bed, and never bother him again.\n[[The events he's describing are shown in two mini-panels below.]]\n\nGuy, off-panel: Nice prank, I guess, but what's the point?\nHat Guy: Check out the owner's card, on the table.\nGuy, off-panel: Chair of the American Skeptics Society?
