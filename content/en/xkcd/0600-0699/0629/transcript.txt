Voice: Where are you going?
Man: Convention.

Voice: What for?
Man: Well, you know furries, right?
Voice: Sure...
[[Man closes suitcase.]]

Man: We're furries whose animal identities have a thing for pretending to be humans.
Voice: I see.

Woman: Great! I've been driving my car and having a job all day!
Man with glasses: Did you meow?
Woman: Not once!
