A study published in the journal of sexual medicine suggests that the g-spot may not actually exist.
We go live to the researchers' press conference:

[[Reporters stand below a researcher at a podium.]]
Reporter: Is it true you've been unable to find evidence that the g-spot exists?

Researcher: My research is in solar cells. I think you have the wrong press conference.

[[Pause]]

Researcher: But ... yes.

{{Title text: The BBC lead was 'The elusive erogenous zone said to exist in some women may be a myth, say researchers who have hunted for it.'  I couldn't read it with a straight face.}}
