TV: Can a ninja catch an arrow? On this episode, we'll find out!
Guy: Mmm, science.
Girl: Hey, Mythbusters is entertaining, but it's not science.
ZF: BRAAAIIIINNS ...
Guy: Zombie Feynman!
ZF: You got a problem with Mythbusters?
Girl: They fail at basic rigor!
ZF: "Ideas are tested by experiment."  That is the _core_ of science.  Everything else is bookkeeping.
ZF: By teaching people to hold their beliefs up to experiment, Mythbusters is doing more to drag humanity out of the unscientific darkness than a thousand lessons in rigor. Show them some love.
ZF: Anyway, back to zombie stuff.  I hunger for BRAAAAAIIINNS!
Guy: Try the physics lab next door.
ZF: I said _brains_.  All they've got are string theorists.
