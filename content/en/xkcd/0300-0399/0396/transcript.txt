Girl: You watched the tape?!
Boy: Yeah, sorry.
Girl: Now you'll die in seven days!
Boy (Now standing to face the girl): It's worse than that.
[[TV is cut from the frame]]
Girl: ...You didn't.
Boy: Yup.
[[Both are now in front of a computer, the girl leaning in.]]
Girl: Great, It's got 363,104 views already.
Boy: They kept Rickrolling me! It was only fair.
