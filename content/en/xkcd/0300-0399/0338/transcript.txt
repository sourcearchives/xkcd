[[The comic has three panels. In the first panel, a boy and a girl are holding hands. A voice bubble originating from a guy standing in the third panel saysâ¦]]
Voice #1: Come explore the future with me!
[[And the girl says something which goes to the third panel.]]
[[The two voice bubbles cross in the middle of the second panel.]]
[[The voice of the girl saysâ¦]]
Voice #2: I can't.
