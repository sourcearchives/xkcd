Elaine breaks RIAA #1, while Stallman disarms RIAA #2 in a flying manouvre]]\nElaine: Thanks, Stallman!\nStallman: 'Tis my pleasure.\nElaine: So, wait - how did you know we were in trouble?\nStallman: My friend here was tracking these thugs from his balloon. He called me and I thought I'd stop by\n[[Doctorow slides down a rope in red cape & goggles]]\nDoctorow: -Hi! Cory Doctorow - It's a pleasure to meet you.\nElaine: Balloon?\nStallman: Aye. They're up there constructing something called a \"Blogosphere.\"\nDoctorow: Yup! Its twenty kilometers up, just above the tag clouds.\nBobby: Mom, I'm hungry.\nMrs. Roberts: Hush! I'm coding. You ate yesterday.\nStallman: You know, Roberts, GNU could use a good coder like you. Ever thought of joining us?\nElaine: Maybe someday. Right now I've got an industry to take down. Music doesn't need these assholes.\nDoctorow: Begone! And never darken our comment threads again!\nStallman: Well, you won't fix the industry with random exploits.
