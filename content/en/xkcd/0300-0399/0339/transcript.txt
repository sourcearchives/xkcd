[[A person is sitting on the floor by a record player.]]
Led Zeppelin: And as we wind on down the road 
 Our shadows taller than our soul

Led Zeppelin: When all is one and one is all 
 To be a rock and not to rooooll

Led Zeppelin (fading): And she's buying a stairway to heaven

Person: Man. The baby boomers are kicking our *asses.* We need to get it together, guys.
