Breadpig is not a traditional publisher.  The majority of the profits of this book are going to the artist, Randall Munroe. And as with all breadpig projects, the company’s profits are being donated to a worthy charity.  We selected the organization Room to Read (<i>RoomToRead.org</i>) which builds schools, establishes libraries, and promotes child education throughout the developing world.  If you’re one of those students reading this in your new school, we’re sorry we insisted on filling the library’s shelves only with copies of this book.

For support in this publishing venture, breadpig thanks Marie Mundaca, LeeAnn Suen, Liz Nagle, and the friends and family who’ve always unhesitatingly supported team breadpig.

Even our winged porcine hero couldn’t have done it alone. Thank you.
