{{How Electric Skateboards Work}}
[[A person is standing on a skateboard, next to a sign that says "Point A," and pushes a button.]]
<<click>>
[[He skates.]]
<<whirrr>>
[[He stops, with a sign saying "Point B" to his right and a group of chicks (labeled "chicks") to his left.]]
{{alt: Both the skateboards I owned were pretty cheap and broke from heavy use; I'm gonna get a really nice one if I move to the city.}}
