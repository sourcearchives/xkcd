[[Two Boys standing somewhere]]
Boy1: I wish I could do math like when i was young.
Boy2: Huh?
Boy1: It doesn't come easy like it once did.
Boy2: Uh huh.
Boy1: Math is a game for the young. I need to sit back and let the future happen.
Boy2: You're thirteen.
Boy1: Yes, and it's time I accept that.
{{Title Text: They say if a mathematician doesn't do their great work by age eleven, they never will. }}
