[[Man in black hat is driving and and the woman who seems to be his equal is in the passenger's seat.  They are closely followed by some other vehicle.]]
Man in black hat: That guy's tailgating me.
Woman: I'll take a look.
Woman: His laptop's running, probably in the back seat. And... yup, the WiFi autoconnects.
Woman: Now we just scan for remote exploits... install speech synth...
Woman: and take a shot in the psychological dark.
Laptop: Hello.
Tailgating man: What? Who's there?
Laptop: She'd be alive if it weren't for you.
Tailgating man: ... Oh God.
{{Title: Okay, now just as the loss hits him, slam on the brakes.}}
