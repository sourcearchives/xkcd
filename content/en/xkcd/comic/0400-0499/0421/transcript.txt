[[A person stands holding a flaming tennis racket. He is throwing a potato in the air as if to serve like a tennis ball. Behind him is a red gas can and a sack of potatoes. Across from him is a another person holding a fork in one hand and balancing a serving tray with a glass of orange juice on it.]]
{{Alt: There are at least fourteen ways this could go badly (seventeen if that fork is a dangerous crossbreed.)}}
