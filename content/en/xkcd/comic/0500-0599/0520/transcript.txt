We visit a bio lab: [[Man and woman visit a bio lab where they look into a tank that the scientists point at.]]
Scientist- "These are cuttlefish."
[[Image of a cuttlefish]] They're frighteningly smart, have manipulating arms and tentacles, have ink jets, can dart backwards and see the polarization of light through their w-shaped pupils. And their sides are 200 dpi display screens which they use for camouflage and communication.
Scientist - "When we realized how intelligent they were, we began to teach them. They've advanced quickly. Cuttlefish: GO."
[[Cuttlefish float out of the tank at man and woman]]
Cuttlefishes- "Kill the physicists... kill the physicists"
[[Cuttlefish zap the man and Megan as they fall]]
Man- [[Waking up from his sleep]] "Oh god. I knew it."
