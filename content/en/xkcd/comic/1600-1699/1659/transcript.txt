[[Two characters are walking.]]
Hat guy: They say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. 
Character: You've been quoting that clich√© for years. Has it convinced anyone to change their mind yet?

{{Title text: I looked up "insanity" in like 10 different dictionaries and none of them said anything like that. Neither did the DSM-4. But I'll keep looking. Maybe it's in the DSM-5!}}
