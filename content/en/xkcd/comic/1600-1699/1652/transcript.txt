[[A person is confronted with a couple, holding their newborn baby. They think a series of thoughts, each of which are crossed out in the thought bubble.]]
Person (thinking): Wow, it's getting so big! Unlike most babies, which stay the same size forever.
Hi! I'm talking to a baby!
What brand is it?
Wow, definitely much smaller than a regular person!
You sure did make that.
4
5 stars, Great baby.
It doesn't really look like you since you're not a baby.
So do they learn words one at a tie alphabetically or can you pick the order or what?
I hope it does a good job.
Person (says aloud): Wow, that's a really cool baby!
Person (thinks): Dammit.

I can never figure out what to say to babies.
