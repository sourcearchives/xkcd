[[Different mathematic equations, all with heart on left side, and all equal question mark. Equations are as follows:
Square root of heart equals question mark
Cosinus of heart equals question mark
Derivative of heart with respect to x  equals question mark
Identity matrix of heart equals question mark
Fourier transform of heart equals question mark]]
My normal approach is useless here
