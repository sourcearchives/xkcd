{{Title text: The best thing about Strunk
White fanfiction is that it's virtually guaranteed to be well written.}}

[[3 dignified-looking editors of Strunk & White's "The Elements of Style" before a desk with a computer. One is seated and types the following:]]

Dear Internet,

    We, the current editors of Strunk & White's "The Elements of Style", must -with great reluctance- clarify a point of orthography:

    "Strunk & White" should be used for the style manual and "Strunk
White" for the erotic fan fiction pairing.
