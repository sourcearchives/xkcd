[[A Man sits at his computer, chatting with some other person.]]
Chat: Wanna see an optical illusion? Hold your keyboard up in front of you and look at the home row.
[[The man holds the keyboard in front of him.]]
Chat: Now cross your eyes a little so the 'g' and 'h' overlap.
Chat: Keeping focus, lift the keyboard over your head.
[[The man lifts the keyboard over his head still looking at the keyboard]]
[[Tiny parts of dust and skin particles fall in the man's face]]
Man: Eww!
Chat: Haha
