[[Four people sit around a table]]
DM: Your party enters the tavern.
Player: I gather everyone around a table. I have the elves start whittling dice and get out some parchment for character sheets.
DM: Hey, no recursing.
{{title-text: I may have also tossed one of a pair of teleportation rings into the ocean, with interesting results.}}
