Beret Guy: What if I had some ice cream? Wouldn't that be awesome?
Person: No, stop--
Beret Guy (thinking):
        Person: Great, you've trapped us in a a hypothetical situation!
        Beret Guy (holding ice cream): Mm, ice cream.
        Person: Maybe if I had a knife I could cut our way free . . .
        Person (thinking):
                Beret Guy: Mmm, ice cream!
                Person (reaching back into previous thought bubble): Here, take this one.
