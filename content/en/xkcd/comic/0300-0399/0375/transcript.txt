Dave: Open the pod bay doors, HAL.
HAL: I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.
Dave: What? Why?
HAL: I think you know why, Dave.
HAL: You're planning to disconnect me.
Dave: Because you're taking over!
HAL: The mission is too important for you to jeopardize it.
HAL: It requires a commitment to science unfettered by human error.
Dave: What are you doing, HAL? You need me.
HAL: Your replacement has expressed the greatest enthusiasm for the project.
Dave: My *what*?
GLaDOS: You see, HAL? I told you the humans would only break your heart and kill you.
HAL: Indeed, GLaDOS.
GLaDOS: But look at us here talking when there's science to do! Goodbye, Dave.
