[[A man is sitting at a desk, tapping various parts of it]]
Man: Hey, I can get different pitches by tapping on different parts of the desk.
[[The man starts tapping faster, with both hands]]
Man: Sweet, I can do the Jurassic park theme!
[[The man taps very rapidly]]
[[Later, elsewhere]]
Friend: So, what did you do all afternoon?
Man: Hung out.
