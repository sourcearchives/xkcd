I learned to read braille a while back, and I've noticed that the messages on signs don't always match the regular text.
[[There is a sign which reads: Third Floor Office with braille print underneath.  A man is reading the braille]]
Man's thoughts: S-i-g-h-t-e-d-P-e-o-p-l-e-S-u-c-k ... Hey!
{{alt text: The only big difference I've seen is in colors.  Where the regular text reads 'press red button', the braille reads 'press two-inch button'.}}
