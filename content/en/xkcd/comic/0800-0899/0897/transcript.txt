Reading guy: It says here that the elevator inspection certificate is on file in the building office.
Middle guy: Whoa, cool! Let's go look at it!
Excited girl: That sounds fun!

Industry tip: Building owners know this never happens. Those signs mark elevators which have never been inspected.

{{Title text: Even governmental elevator inspectors get bored halfway through asking where the building office is.}}
