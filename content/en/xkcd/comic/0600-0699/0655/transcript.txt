[[A man is apparently ascending a climbing wall.]]

[[We see him again in silhouette, as well as the edge of another person standing at a ninety degree angle to him with her feet on the wall above him.]]

[[The "climber" stops and looks up at the woman, who is standing on the "vertical" wall, looking at him.]]

Woman: Your facebook rock climbing pictures just got a lot less impressive.

{{Title text: Where did you even get this wall? Return it there and stand it back up right now.}}
