[[A banner flutters in the breeze, evidently attached to the elevator it mentions in its text. It reads "SPACE ELEVATOR" "GRAND OPENING"]]
[[A space elevator occupies the height of the frame, consisting of a bass, a ribbon extending out into space, and an elevator unit with standard elevator features such as sliding doors and up
down buttons.]]
((The following lines appear split across the elevator itself, the rhyming portions of the text separated from the others.))
AFTER COUNTLESS    ENGINEERS
SPEND TRILLIONS OVER    FIFTY YEARS,
A MODERN BABEL    DISAPPEARS
BECAUSE SOME FUCK BROUGHT    PRUNING SHEARS
[[Five individuals stand at the base of the elevator: a brunette woman, a man, a blond woman who has recently opened a bottle of champagne, an alarmed man, and Hat Guy, who has smuggled the aforementioned shears into the ceremony and unceremoniously turned it into a ribbon cutting.]]

{{Title text: Although really, the damage was done when the party planners took the hole punch to the elevator ribbon to hang up the sign.}}
