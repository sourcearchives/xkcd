[[A terrorist is holding a gun and talking on a cell phone to the boss.]]
Terrorist: We took the hostages, secured the building, and cut the communication lines like you said.
Boss: Excellent.

Terrorist: But then this guy climbed up the ventilation ducts and walked across broken glass, killing anyone we sent to stop him.
Boss: And he rescued the hostages?

Terrorist: No, he ignored them. He just reconnected the cables we cut, muttering something about "uptime."
Boss: Shit, we're dealing with a sysadmin.

{{Title text: The weird sense of duty really good sysadmins have can border on the sociopathic, but it's nice to know that it stands between the forces of darkness and your cat blog's servers.}}
