[[A guy is looking at a kindle]]
Girl: A Kindle? E Books, huh?
Guy: Ebooks are for chumps.
Girl: Why get a kindle, then?
Guy: One reason:
FREE Cellular web access. Even if I spend months broke and drunk in a strange city, I'll still be able to use wikipedia and wikitravel to learn about anything I need.
Girl: Why does that sound familiar? Gimme that. [[Girls takes the kindle]]
[[The top of the kindle says "Amazon Kindle"]]
[[Girl scratches at the top]] <<scrape, scrape, scrape>>
Top of "kindle": Hitchhiker's Guid...
{{Alt-text: I'm happy with my Kindle 2 so far, but if they cut off the free Wikipedia browsing, I plan to show up drunk on Jeff Bezos's lawn and refuse to leave.}}
