You have to see it for yourself.\nTrinity (correcting Morpheus): Sure you can.  It's a computer simulation in which you live, thinking it's reality.\nNeo: Oh.\nTrinity (to Morpheus, who is glaring at her): ... What?  Look, maybe you just suck at explaining.\n[[Scene 2]]\nMorpheus (to Neo): ...Or you take the red pill, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.\n[[Neo takes BOTH pills from Morpheus...]]\n[[Neo crushes both the red and blue pills into purple powder on a table top...]]\n[[Neo snorts the purple powder...]]\n[[Morpheus and Neo are shown upside down in a frame with inverted colors, i.e., black background with white lines]]\nMorpheus: NOW look what you've done.\nNeo: Where are we?\nMorpheus: I have no idea.\n[[Scene 3]]\n[[Neo, wearing the long  black trench coat, at a metal detector, is accosted by the security guard.]]\nGuard: Please remove any keys, metallic items, weapons--\n[[Neo opens his trench coat, his back to the reader, towards the guard, who is facing the reader.
