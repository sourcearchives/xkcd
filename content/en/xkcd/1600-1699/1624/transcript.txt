[[A figure and two women stand on a hill around two bare trees.]]
Woman: One day a year, the sun sets directly between these two trees.
Figure: Oh, cool - like the Manhattan thing. 

[[The figure stands alone in thought.]]

[[We see a close-up of the three of them. The sun shines behind them.]]
Figure: Wait, isn't that true every day for pretty much any two trees? 
Other woman: Shh, here it comes! 

[[The sun is lower in the sky. The first woman holds a net on a pole, while the other has a bag.]]
Figure: Wait, what? 
Woman: OK, Got the bag? 
Other woman: Yup, grab it! 
Woman: We're gonna be rich!

{{Title text: I've got the Craigslist post ready to go! I wasn't sure what category it should go in, so I listed it as property and put that it has 'good sun exposure.'}}
