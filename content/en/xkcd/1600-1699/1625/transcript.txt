((This is like a flowchart. The first line has arrows pointing to all the subsequent lines.))
It's 2016 - where's my...
Flying car â They're called "Helicopters" 
Jetpack â Turns out people are huge wimps about crashing
Moon colony â No one has put up the cash
Self-driving car â Coming surprisingly soon
Floating sky city â Turns out cities are heavy
Hoverboard â This question is now ambiguous thanks to a new scooter thing (and will lead to an argument about the meaning of "hoverboard" which is way less interesting than either kind of hoverboard)
Robot butler â He was called "Jeeves" and he wasn't that great

{{Title text: The real loser in an argument about the meaning of the word 'hoverboard' is anyone who leaves that argument on foot.}}
