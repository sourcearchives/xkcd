[[Man holding cell phone talks to a man at a desk littered with objects]]
Man with phone: Hey, what's your cell number?
Man at desk: (Violet Brown Gray) - Uh, I mean, (718)-387-6962.
Man with phone: Okay, you are putting down those resistors and going outside for a while.
Man at desk: That's probably a good idea.
