[[Two people are in a room.  One is standing up.  There is litter around them.]]
Standing man: Okay, that's all the Ghostbusters marathon I can handle. Later!
Man #2: You can't leave! We just started the animated series!

Standing man: I've had my fill. I'm going home.
Man #2: I can't let you do that.

[[The man walks along a cord, and past a box.  The other man clicks a switch.]]
<<Click>>

[[The standing man is bathed in some kind of aura emitted by the box.]]
