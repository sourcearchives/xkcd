[[A guy sits on a toilet in a bathroom. The stall sidewalll next to him is covered in graffiti--"you suck," "Mike sucks cock," "Cunt," "dane was here" stuck through and "dane is a fag" written under it. One block of graffiti is salient:]]
"This graffitii is
fleeting human contact
both of us lost,
but for a moment
we're lost together.
I wonder who you are."
Subtitle: I think I look for meaning in the wrong places sometimes.
