[[A courtroom. A judge sits on a stage at the right. Another man sits, downcast, behind a desk at the left. A man, Zeno, stands centre left holding an arrow.]]
Zeno: My client couldn't have killed anyone with this arrow, and I can *prove* it! 
Judge: I'd like to examine your proof, Zeno. You may approach the bench. 
Zeno: Â– But never reach it!
