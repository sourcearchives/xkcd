[[A figure with a hat is talking to another figure.]]
Hat: ... No, but see, it's a movie

Figure: Sounds like masturbatory navel-gazing.

Hat: No, it's about blurring the line between metaphor and reality.
Hat: You just don't know much about art.

Figure: I know

Michael Jordan
 of blurring the line between metaphor and reality.

[[The figure walks away.]]
Hat: ... huh?

[[A basketball flies into the panel and knocks the figure's hat off.]]
