[[Six traffic lights are hanging from a wire.  A bird is on the wire.  This is animated.]]
[[On the far left, a pole has a sign disallowing all directions.]]
[[The first light on the left has a right turn only sign.]]
[[The next light has straight and right turn only.]]
[[The far right light has a left turn only sign.]]
[[If you watch long enough, the lights do odd things such as turn purple, or light up all three red.]]

{{Title text: There's an intersection I drive through sometimes that has a forward green arrow, a red light, and a 'no turns' sign all on one pole. I honestly have no idea what it's telling me to do.}}
