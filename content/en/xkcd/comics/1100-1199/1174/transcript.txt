[[A really damn stupid website being viewed in a mobile browser.  A popup covers absolutely everything and makes the entire page unusable.  "Want to visit an incomplete version of our website where you can't zoom? Download our app!". With buttons "OK" and "no, but ask me again every time".  Assholes.]]

{{Title text: If I click 'no', I've probably given up on everything, so don't bother taking me to the page I was trying to go to. Just drop me on the homepage. Thanks.}}
