[[A man is sitting at a desk typing at his computer while a man and a woman look over his shoulder.]]
Man: (typing) Hey, party tonight? We'd all love to come see your new place!
PC Screen: Wait, what?

[[The other side of the conversation: a guy typing on a laptop at a table.]]
Laptop Screen: We want to hang out!
Guy: (typing) We're not, like, good friends.
Laptop Screen: I know, but we were thinking about it and we really like you! 

[[The three people again. The man behind the man in the chair is clasping his hands in anticipation.]]
Man: (typing) You should have us over tonight! For, like, an hour. It'll be fun!
PC Screen: Well, uh, sure.
