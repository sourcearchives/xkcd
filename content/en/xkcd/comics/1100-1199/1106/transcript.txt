[[A person holding onto a balloon labeled "math problem" goes to grab another labeled "call mom"]]

[["Check Oven" appears off in the distance]]

[[The person lets go of the first two..]]

[[..leaps up and grabs "Check Oven]]

[[More balloons.  "parking meter", "taxes", "buy soap", "phone call", "relax", "inbox", "clean", "beat game", "feed cat", "drink water", "call mom", "math problem", "send card", "check oven", "engine light", "read", "breathe"  all show up at once.]]

{{Title text: 20 balloons float away while I'm busy permanently tying one to a tree to deal with it for good. Unfortunately, that one balloon was 'land a rocket on the moon in Kerbal Space Program.'}}
