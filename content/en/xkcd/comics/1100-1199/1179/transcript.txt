Public Service Announcement:

Our different ways of writing dates as numbers can lead to online confusion.  That's why in 1988 ISO set a global standard numeric date format.  

This is *the* correct way to write numeric dates:

2013-02-27

The following formats are therefore discouraged:

02
27
2013 02

13 27
