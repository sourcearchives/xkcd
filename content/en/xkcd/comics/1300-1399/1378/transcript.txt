[[A character is standing near a wind turbine.]]
Character: I'll hold up a big kite, and you blow air at me until I lift off!
Character: What do you think of that idea?
Turbine: I'm not a huge fan.

{{Title text: Ok, plan B: Fly a kite into the blades, with a rock in a sling dangling below it, and create the world's largest trebuchet.}}
