[[A person is sitting at a desk, typing on a laptop.]]
Person: What I'm trying to do is really simple. It shouldn't be hard.

[[Someone off-screen speaks.]]
Off-screen: All computers are just carefully organized sand. 
Everything
 is hard until someone makes it easy.

[[The person leans back in their chair.]]

[[The person lifts the laptop off the desk, examining it like a book.]]
Person: Maybe I should turn this one 
back
 into sand.
Off-screen: I'll find a blowtorch.
