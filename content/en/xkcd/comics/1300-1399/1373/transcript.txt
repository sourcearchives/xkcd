When someone posts a screenshot of their phone,

[[Image depicts a phone screenshot as part of a post on a website. In the screenshot, the battery indicator is at 6%. The battery indicator portion of the screenshot is circled in bright red circles, and bright red exclamation marks have been added.]]

I can't pay attention to the content if their battery is low.
