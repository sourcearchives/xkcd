[[A figure wearing glasses is looking at his phone.]]
My hobby: 
Figure: OK, Glass, check tomorrow's weather. Ooh, snow! 
Off-panel figure: Oh my God, it's somehow even more annoying than if you had it. 
Saying "OK, Glass" before everything while wearing regular glasses. 

{{Title text: Plus, when someone finally grabs your glasses and stomps on them, it costs way less than $1,500 to replace them.}}
