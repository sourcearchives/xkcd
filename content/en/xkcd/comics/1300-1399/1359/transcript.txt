[[A flow chart. First box says, 'Alarm goes off' which leads with a straight arrow to the next box, reading 'BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP'. One curved arrow leads from this box back to itself. Another leads in the opposite direction to a box that says, '"???"'. From that an arrow leads down to 'Answer phone in dream', which leads to 'talk', which leads to 'hang up', which leads back to 'BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP'.]]
