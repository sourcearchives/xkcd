[[In the center of the panel are the large words 'GOLDBACH CONJECTURES'. Around it are six boxes: two above it, and two on each side, one below the other. They read:
Weak: Every odd number greather than 5 is the sum of three primes.
Strong: Every even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes.
Very weak: Every number greater than 7 is the sum of two other numbers.
Very strong: Every odd number is prime.
Extremely weak: Numbers just 
keep going
.
Extremely strong: There are no numbers above 7.

{{Title text: The weak twin primes conjecture states that there are infinitely many pairs of primes. The strong twin primes conjecture states that every prime p has a twin prime (p+2), although (p+2) may not look prime at first. The tautological prime conjecture states that the tautological prime conjecture is true.}}
