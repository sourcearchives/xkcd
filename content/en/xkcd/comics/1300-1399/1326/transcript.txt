[[The character is sitting on a throne, talking to a minion who's not shown in the panel.]]
Minion: The prisoner escaped and is swimming toward the mainland!
Leader: 
Release the sharks.

Minion: Yes, sir.

Minion: The sharks are swimming away.
Leader: They're escaping, too? Send sharks after them!

Minion: Now 
those
 sharks are swimming away.
Leader: 
More sharks.

Minion: ... sir, what's going on?
Leader: Prisoners, of course! Can't let 'em escape!

Minion: Sir, are you trying to turn Doom Island into a marine biology center?
Leader: 
Shark populations are in decline--

Leader: *ahem*
Leader: I mean, the world must fear us!
Minion: Right...

{{Title text: 'Now, minions, I'm off to inspect our shark cages.' 'Do you really need to inspect them this often?' 'PRISONERS MUST NEVER ESCAPE.'}}
