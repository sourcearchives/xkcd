[[A physical bell-curve-shaped object labeled "Student's t distribution" is resting on a table. A figure is working with it and a piece of paper.]]
Figure: hmm

[[The figure looks at the piece of paper.]]
Figure: ...nope.

[[The figure picks up the object and begins to walk off the panel with it.]]

[[The figure comes back onto the panel, now carrying an object shaped like a much more complex curve, with many symmetric spikes and dips, labeled "Teacher's t distribution".]]

{{Title text: If data fails the Teacher's t test, you can just force it to take the test again until it passes.}}
