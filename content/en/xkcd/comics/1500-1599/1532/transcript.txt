[[On the black screen, a small grayish circle appears.]]

[[It grows slightly larger, and a differentiation of colors can be seen, white and gray.]]

[[Larger still, now landmasses and water are visible.]]

[[It is now large enough to see that we are looking at the Earth, with Africa, Europe, and some of Asia visible.]]

[[One person is still looking at the screen while the other is walking away.]]
One: Ok, who did the calculations for the Jupiter slingshot maneuver?
Two: 
Dammit, Steve...
