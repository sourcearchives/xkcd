[[This will not make sense if you do not know what Pokemon is.]]
[[A seemingly infite row of Pikachu stands, each next to an open pokéball. The pokemon on the end of the row, nearest to the trainers, has a closed pokéball.]]
Pikachu: Pikachu, I choose YOU!

[[There are two trainers. One has an open pokéball. The other is staring at their watch.]]

{{Title text: This would be bad enough, but every 30th or 40th pokéball has TWO of them inside.}}
