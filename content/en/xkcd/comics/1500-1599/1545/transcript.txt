[[Two characters sit at a table, opposite one another. One is an INTERVIEWER, the other an APPLICANT]]
Interviewer: What would you say is your biggest weakness?

Applicant: Probably that I'm a giant tangle of parts that don't always work right, so I can die easily.

Interviewer: Biggest strength?
Applicant: There will come a day when I'm either an ancesotr to ALL living humans, or to NONE of them.

Interviewer: Where do you see yourself in five years?
Applicant: Probably not the ancestor of all living humans yet. But you never know!

{{Title text: Do you need me to do a quicksort on the whiteboard or produce a generation of offspring or something? It might take me a bit, but I can do it.}}
