[[This comic uses a series of venn diagrams to show "Words I use to refer to a pet over the years that I live with"]]

First year: Primarily the pet's name, and sometimes words related to the pet.

Second year: Primarily words related to the pet, and sometimes the pets name or coherent words of any kind.

Third year: Words related to the pet, or coherent words of any kind, and sometimes not even that.

Fourth year onward: Terms which do not belong in any of the aforementioned categories.

{{Title text: Seventh year: Perfectly coherent words, but in the pet's language, not mine.}}
