[[Two figures stand in front of a glorious skyscape]]
Figure: I like the sky
Second figure: Yeah

[[The CLOUDS are ALIGHT in a GLORIOUS SPECTACLE which eludes description]]

Second figure: It's one of my favorite halves.

{{Title text: The other half has some cool shipwrecks, rocks, and snakes, but if you move those out of the way, it also has more sky.}}
