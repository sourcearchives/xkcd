[[An AMATEUR CODER excitedly gestures a PRO CODER towards a laptop computer on a desk.]]
Amateur: Keep in mind that I'm self-taught, so my code may be a little messy.
Pro: Lemme see, I'm sure it's fine.

[[PRO CODER sits at the desk, clacking at the laptop.]]
Pro: Wow. This is like being in a house built by a child using nothing but a hatchet and a picture of a house.

[[PRO CODER leans forward, slightly engrossed.]]
Pro: It's like a salad recipe written by a corporate lawyer using a phone autocorrect that only knew excel formulas.

[[PRO CODER leans back, slightly horrified.]]
Pro: It's like someone took a transcript of a couple arguing at ikea and made random edits until it compiled without errors.
Amateur: OKAY I will read a style guide.
