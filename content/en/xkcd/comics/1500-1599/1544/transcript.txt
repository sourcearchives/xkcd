[[A single woman, MARGARET, speaks alone, in the darkness.]]

Margaret: Are you there, god? It's me, Margaret.
Margaret: I know you're listening.

[[Margaret appears larger.]]
Margaret: Are you scared, god?
Margaret: Are you?

[[Only her head face is seen now. The lack of expression on her ovoid countenance is truly horrifying.]]
Margaret: You should be.

[[Silhouetted against the darkness, Margaret stands alone.]]
Margaret: MARGARET IS COMING FOR YOU.

{{Title text: Otherwise known as Margaret the Destroyer, I will bring pain to the the Great One. Then again, maybe I won't.}}
