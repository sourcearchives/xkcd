[[Two figures sit at a table. One is IMBIBING from a large BOTTLE. The other is cradling what could be a cup of coffee, or a squarish bomb, or even a boxy of custom size condoms.

IMBIBER: Maybe this is the vodka talking, but:
HI! I'M MADE FROM POTATOES!

{{Title text: Or whatever's handy! I'm pretty much pure alcohol and water, so it doesn't really matter!}}
