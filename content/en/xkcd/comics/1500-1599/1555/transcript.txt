[[Title: Exoplanet names 2]]
NASA has announced the discovery of a (super)earth sized planet in the habitable zone of a sun-like star.

I suggest we name this planet "pluto", both to celebrate the great work by the new horizons team, and to make the stupid "is pluto a planet" debate a little more confusing.

While we wait to hear from the IAU, here's a revised and updated list of planet name suggestions, see xkcd.com
