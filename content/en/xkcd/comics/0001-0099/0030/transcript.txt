[[Three people stand in the foyer of a restaurant. A sign above the entryway reads "JOE'S" and there is a menu next to it. In front of the entryway, there's a host behind a podium. A sign on the podium reads "EAT IN".]]
Host: Donner, party of four?
Man: Actually, never mind.
Woman: We're full.
{{title text: Some people haven't heard of the Donner Party.  They were pioneers who got stranded and likely resorted to cannibalism.}}
