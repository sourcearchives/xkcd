[[Texts reads 'Fields arranged by purity'. An arrow is shown pointing right with the text 'more pure'. Six people are shown representing six scientific fields. They stand on a scale of purity with the left end representing less purity and the right representing more purity. They appear in this order, from left to right: Sociology, Psychology, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics. The mathematician stands much further to the right than any other field.]]
Psychologist: Sociology is just applied Psychology.
Biologist: Psychology is just applied Biology.
Chemist: Biology is just applied Chemistry
Physicist: Which is just applied Physics. It's nice to be on top.
Mathematician: Oh, hey, I didn't see you guys all the way over there.
{{Alt-text: On the other hand, physicists like to say physics is to math as sex is to masturbation.}}
