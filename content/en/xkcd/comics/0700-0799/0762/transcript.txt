[[Two men sit in front of the TV, one on the couch, the other on the floor. A woman stands by the TV set.]]
Woman: While I'm up, does anyone want a sandwich?
Man 1: Is "sandwich" a metaphor?

Woman: No, I'm bad at metaphors. But I could try a simile.
Man 1: I guess that's 
like
 a metaphor. Sure.

[[As the woman starts to walk away, the men continue to speak.]]
Man 2: Well, "a simile is like a metaphor" is a simile.
Man 1: Is that simile itself a metaphor for something?
Man 2: Maybe it's a metaphor for analogy.

[[The two men are still sitting in the same place while the woman is out of the panel.]]
Man 1: Similes 
are
 metaphors in that they're both analogies.
Woman: Analogies are like sandwiches in that I'm making one now.
