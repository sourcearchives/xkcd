My Dearest Cordelia,

It has been far too long since I last gazed upon your lithe and supple body through my telescopic sights, and I fear you may have found a superior vantage poin--

<<BLAM!>> <<BLAM!>> <<BLAM!>>

--a splendid effort, my love, but your shots find only a decoy, and reveal your position atop the maintenance shed.

I pray this missive and my grenades find you well.

War is hell.
