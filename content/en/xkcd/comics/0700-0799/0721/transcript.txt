[[Person encounters a square on the ground.]]
Person: Hey, A. Square. How's Flatland?
A. Square: Still flat. What's up?
Person: I just spent an hour playing a demo of this 4D game called Miegakure.

[[A character in Miegakure jumps around the 4D landscape.]]
Trying to jump from block to block in four dimensions hurt my brain.

Person: So I apologize for giving you a hard time when you were slow to understand 3D space. I sympathize now.
A. Square: It's okay.

Person: Also, I apologize for drawing arms, legs, and eyes on you to make you look like Spongebob. That was out of line.
A. Square: Yes, it was.

{{Title text: Also, I apologize for the time I climbed down into your world and everyone freaked out about the lesbian orgy overseen by a priest.}}
