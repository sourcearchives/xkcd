[[Two cowboys face off silently in the desert, the blazing sun beating down.]]

[[They exchange steely glares, hands poised to reach their guns, as a tumbleweed rolls into frame.]]
<<TUMBLE>>

[[Close-up on the tumbleweed. It draws two guns.]]
<<CLICK CLICK>>

[[The tumbleweed shoots both cowboys simultaneously, and they fall backwards.]]
<<BLAM BLAM>>

{{Title text: The tumbleweed then tried to roll off into the sunset, but due to the Old West's placement north of the subtropical ridge, the prevailing winds were in the wrong direction.}}
