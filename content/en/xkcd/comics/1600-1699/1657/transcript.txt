[[There's a clock, set to 3 minutes to midnight. It has a caption:]]
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Doomsday Clock

[[A character walks into the panel.]]
Character: Oh hey, spring forward. 

[[The character grabs the hour hand and pulls it to 1AM.]]

[[We see 6 mushroom clouds and 3 other explosions.]]

{{Title text: After a power outage at the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, the new Digital Doomsday Clock is flashing 00:00 and mushroom clouds keep appearing and then retracting once a second.}}
