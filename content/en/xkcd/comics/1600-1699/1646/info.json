A group of other people are in the background behind them.]]\nHost: Welcome to Stargazing, with your host, me. I'm a doctor or whatever.\n\n[[She continues to talk.]]\nHost: I'm not gonna waste your time on the shitty stars. Just the good tuff. Honestly half of 'em just look like dots.\n\n((Normal color panel - black on white))\n[[A shot from far away of the host standing in the center of the group of people watching her, she points to the sky.]]\nHost: This is Sirius. It's the brightest star in our sky so it's in charge. It's really two stars, but one of them is barely even trying. This is Andromeda. It's too big to think about, so let's not.\n\n((Inverse color panel))\n[[Close-up on the host gesturing toward the sky behind her.]]\nHost: That red star is Betelgeuse. It's gonna explode someday. Can't happen soon enough, as far as I'm concerned.
