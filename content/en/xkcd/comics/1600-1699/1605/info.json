There's a ton of feedback and external processing.\n\nPerson 2: But even if it were, DNA is the result of the most aggressive optimization process in the universe, running in parallel at every energy level, in every living thing, for four billion years.\nWhite Hat Guy: It's still just code.\n[[White Hat Guy sits down at a desk with a laptop]]\n\nPerson 2: Ok, try opening google.com and clicking \"view source\".\nWhite Hat Guy: Ok, I- ...oh my god.\nPerson 2: That's just a few years of optimization by Google devs.  DNA is thousands of times longer and way, *way* worse.\nWhite Hat Guy: Wow, biology is *impossible*.\n\n{{Title text: Researchers just found the gene responsible for mistakenly thinking we've found the gene for specific things.
