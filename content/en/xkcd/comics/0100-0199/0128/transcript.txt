Will it ever stop hurting?
dPain
dt = (-k_1 Pain + [Image of girl]) (1 
 (1 + e ^ -(t - k_2)
d))
k_1=?
k_2=?
[Image of girl]=How much she's still in my life
Please let d only be a few days... or weeks
I guess there's some kind of a cutoff after years, where it stops mattering and we can be friends. Do I _want_ that?
Is k_1 positive? Is k_2 large?
Will I ever stop feeling like this?
