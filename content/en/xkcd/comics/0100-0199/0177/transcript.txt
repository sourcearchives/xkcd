Girl: I'm sure you've heard all about this sordid affair in those gossipy cryptographic protocol specs with those busybodies Schneier and Rivest, always taking Alice's side, always labeling me the attacker.
Girl: Yes, it's true.  I broke Bob's private key and extracted the text of her messages.  But does anyone realize how much it hurt?

Girl: I didn't want to believe.  Of course on some level I realized it was a known-plaintext attack.  But I couldn't admit it until I saw it for myself.
