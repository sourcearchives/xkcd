[[Interior, man types on computer, friend is lying on the floor]]
Man [[typing swear words]]: *$@#
Friend: Hey, ease up on the noobs.  Like my Mom always said, you catch more flies with honey then with vinegar.
Man: No, you don't.
Friend: You don't?
Man: Nope, set out a bowl of balsamic and a bowl of honey.  The vinegar gets more.
Friend: ...Seriously?
Man: You have fruit flies. Try it yourself.
[[Later]]
Friend [[on the phone with his mother]]: Mother! You LIED to me!  And it gets worse.  I was watching a pot yesterday, and guess what it did?  It BOILED, Mother!
{{title text: I don't know about houseflies, but we definitely caught a lot of fruit flies with our vinegar bowl. Hooray science!}}
