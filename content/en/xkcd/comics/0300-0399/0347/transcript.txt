[[Inset: A man prepares to throw a tennis ball upward.]]
[[The man lies on the ground, underneath the titular archway, next to two halves of a brick. Dust falls from the place in the archway where the man knocked the brick from with the tennis ball. The ball, meanwhile, has rolled about a meter away.]]
"Breakout" is a stupid game.
