[[A post-it note which reads, 
Dear Isaac
Do you like me?
(box)Yes
(box)No
(handwritten in red ink - a checked box) there is as yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer]]

{{Title text: The universe long dead, Isaac surveyed the formless chaos. At last, he had arrived at an answer. 'I like you,' he declared to the void, 'but I don't LIKE like you.'}}
