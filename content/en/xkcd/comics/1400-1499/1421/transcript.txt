# Dear future self,
# You're looking at this file because the parse function finally broke.
# It's not fixable. You have to rewrite it.  Sincerely, past self

Man:  Dear past self, it's kinda creepy how you do that.

# Also, it's probably at least 2013.  Did you ever take that trip to Iceland?

Man:  Stop judging me!
