Black hat guy: All the birds from "March of the Penguins" are now dead. 

[[We just see the woman at her laptop; black hat guy is off-panel.]]
Woman: OK, I *get* it. We're all aging. 
Black hat guy: What? No.

[[The woman has turned around in her seat to look at black hat guy.]]
Black hat guy: I'm not trying to make you feel old. They were alive last night. I'm trying to apologize.
Woman: Oh God
