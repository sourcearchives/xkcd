Douchebag with a goatee and a bad haircut: Even though it technically *wasn't* cheating, she dumped me anyway! So I tell Bret, and he's like "She sounds just like my crazy ex." And I was like, "dude, what was her name?" and it was the *same girl*.  I swear, if they made my life into a movie, no one would believe it.
Person 2: Yeah, though mostly because of the poorly-written dialogue and unlikeable main character.

{{Title text: Roger Ebert once called you directionless and unwatchable.}}
