[[Some IDIOT used a font with TERRIBLE kerning on the side of a building for a sign labeled "CITY OFFICES".  Only.. you aren't even frickin' sure because of this terrible kerning, as the "C" and the "I" in "CITY" have waaay too strong kerning. And so do the "C" and the "E" in "OFFICES", to the point that it actually looks like TWO words.  And the I and the C are so close together, they almost look like a freakish K!  Two people stand in front of this sign. One notices all these obvious flaws, while the other exists in peaceful ignorance.]]
Person 1: *Argh*!
Person 2: what?
If you really hate someone, teach them to recognize bad kerning.
