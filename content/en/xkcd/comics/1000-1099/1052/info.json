First up is a philosopher.]]\nPhilosophy's just math sans rigor, sense, and practicality\n\nAnd math's just physics unconstrained by precepts of reality.\n\nA business major's just a thing you get so you can graduate\n\nAnd chemistry's for stamp collectors high on methylacetate.\n\nWhy anyone who wants a job would study lit's a mystery\n\nUnless their only other choice were something like art history.\n\nA BA in communications guarantees that you'll achieve\n\nA little less than if you'd learned to underwater basket-weave\n\nI'd rather eat a Fowler's Toad than major in biology,\n<<Ribbit>>\n\nAnd social psych is worse than either psych \nor\n sociology.\n\n[[At this point the singer is shown talking to a balding professor at a desk.]]\nThe thought of picking any one of these is too unbearable.\n\nJust put me down as \"Undecided\" -- Every major's terrible.\n\n[[Back to pictures of majors.]]\nNow, if you can't prognosticate, that's ok in seismology,\n\nBut if your hindsight's weak as well, you'd best stick to theology.\n\nCS will make each day a quest to find a missing close-paren.\n\nVirology will guarantee you'll never get a hug again.\n\nI.T. prepares you for a life of fighting with PCs nonstop.\n\nAs Pratchett said, \nTerry Pratchett: \"Geography's just physics slowed with trees on top.\"\n\nThough physics seems to promise you a Richard Feynman-like career,\n\nThe Wiki page for \"Physics Major\" redirects to \n\"Engineer.\"\n\n\nThey say to study history or find yourself repeating it,\n\nBut all that it prepares you for is forty years of teaching it.\n\n[[And back to the explanation at the desk.]]\nI recognize my four-year plan's at this point not repairable,\n\nBut put me down as \"Undecided\" -- every major's terrible.\n\n[[More pictures of majors.
