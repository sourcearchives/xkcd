[[Three people stand facing what we can assume are the Doors of Durin (not pictured). One has a hat, one has hair, the other has neither.]]
Hair: I've got it! What's the Elvish word for friend?
Neither: 
Mellon.


[[The three watch as the doors begin to open.]]
<<RUMBLE>>

[[The one in the white hat poses a question.]]
Hat: So what's the Elvish word for "frenemy"? 
Neither: ...
mellogoth?

<<SLAM!!>>

{{Title text: If we get the doors open and plug up the dam on the Sirannon so the water rises a little, the pool will start draining into Moria. How do you think the Watcher would fare against a drenched Balrog?}}
