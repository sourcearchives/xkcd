[[A figure sits on a hill reading a book.]]

[[The figure remains engrossed in the book. A balloon begins to descend behind him.]]

[[The figure continues reading. The balloon is getting lower.]]

[[The balloon is now right behind the figure's ear.]]
Balloon: Internet.
Figure: Augh!
[[The man throws the book in surprise.]]

[[The balloon ascends rapidly, while the startled figure looks up.]]
