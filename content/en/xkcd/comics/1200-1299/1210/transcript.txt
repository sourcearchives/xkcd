[[Black Hat Man is working peacefully at his computer when an annoying little brat runs up behind him and goes..]]
Annoying Brat: MONKEY TACOS! I'm so random!

Black Hat Man: Me too!

[[Black Hat Man spews an enormous torrent of random numbers, and the annoying brat is blasted away]]

[[Black Hat Man returns to work in peace]]

{{Title text: In retrospect, it's weird that as a kid I thought completely random outbursts made me seem interesting, given that from an information theory point of view, lexical white noise is just about the opposite of interesting by definition.}}
