A guide to integration by parts: 
Given a problem of the form:
â«f(x)g(x)dx = ? 
Choose variables u and v such that: 
u = f(x)
dv = g(x)dx
Now the original expression becomes:
â«udv = ? 
Which 
definitely
 looks easier. 
Anyway, I gotta run. 
But good luck!

{{Title text: If you can manage to choose u and v such that u = v = x, then the answer is just (1
2)x^2, which is easy to remember. Oh, and add a '+C' or you'll get yelled at.}}
