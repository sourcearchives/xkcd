[[Black hat guy is sitting at a desk, using a laptop. He's talking to a figure standing behind him.]]
Figure: They said on the news that they found a giant ring lying in a field outside Chicago. Strung with some kind of superstrong mesh. 
Black hat guy: Mhm? 

Figure: Then they found a 260-mile long shaft connected to the ring, running from Chicago to St. Louis. In St. Louis they found a gigantic winch. 
Black hat guy: Did they. 

Figure: It sounds kind of like... ...a butterfly net. 

Figure: ... Are you planning to catch the International Space Station?
Black hat guy: I'm planning to catch *an* international space station. Not sayin' which.
