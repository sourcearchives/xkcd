San Francisco, December 9th, 1968: 
[[We see a figure talking into a headset. It's a fair assumption that it's Douglas Engelbart.]]
Douglas: ... We generated video signals with a cathode ray tube... We have a pointing device we call a "mouse"... I can "copy" text... ... and we have powerful join file editing... underneath the file here we can exchange "direct messages"...

[[Douglas continues to narrate. Some music is playing.]]
Douglas: ... Users can share files... ... files which can encode audio samples, using our "masking codecs"... The file you're hearing now is one of my own compositions...
Music: I heard there was a secret chord

[[Douglas continues to narrate.]]
Douglas: ... And you can superimpose text on the picture of the cat, like so... This cat is saying "YOLO", which stands for "You Only Live Once"... ...Just a little acronym we thought up...
