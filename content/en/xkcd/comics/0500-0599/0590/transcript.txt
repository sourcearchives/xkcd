My Hobby:
Getting typography geeks heartfelt cards printed in "papyrus" and watching them struggle to act grateful.
Woman: Thank you for the <<Twitch>> ... lovely... <<Twitch>> birthday card!
[[The woman is holding a card open and looking at someone.  An angry tic is flicking on her forehead.]]

{{Title text: I secretly, deep in my guilty heart, like Papyrus and don't care if it's overused. [Cue hate mail in beautifully-kerned Helvetica.]}}
