Guy: So you can come up with a song title fitting any tag combination?
Girl: Try me.
Guy: Lesbian voyeurism one-hit wonder mash-up.
Girl: "I wish that Stacey's Mom had Jessie's Girl."
<<silence>>
Guy: Well, that was one, but-
Girl: "When you Come On Eileen I touch myself."
Guy: Okay, wow.
{{Title-text: I love Eileen 
 and want you to love her 
 When you're around 
 I'm one floor above her 
 If you could see 
 just how much I adore her 
 Oh, that pretty red dress 
 I'd do anything for her 
  (Too ra loo ra too ra loo rye ayy)}}
