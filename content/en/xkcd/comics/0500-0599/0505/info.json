I worked out the kinks in quantum mechanics and relativity.\nNarrator: Took a lot of thinking, but this place has fewer distractions than a Swiss patent office.\n[[Man is walking along the desert, laying out rocks]]\nNarrator: One day I started laying down rows of rocks.\n[[Man continues to deploy rocks]]\nNarrator: Each new row followed from the last in a simple pattern.\n[[Image continues to zoom out showing laid out rocks]]\nNarrator: With the right set of rules and enough space,\nNarrator: I was able to build a computer.\nNarrator: Each new row of stones is the next iteration of the computation.\nNarrator: Sure it's rocks instead of electricity, but it's the same* thing.\nNarrator: Just slower.\nNotation: *Turing-complete\n[[Man in contemplative pose]]\nNarrator: After a while, I programmed it to be a physics simulator.\n[[Image of binary encoding depicted in rocks]]\nNarrator: Every piece of information about a particle was encoded as a string of bits written in the stones.\n[[Representations of two particles interacting]]\nNarrator: With enough time and space, I could fully simulate two particles interacting.\n[[Man standing before the vastness of the desert]]\nNarrator: But I have infinite time and space.\n[[Depiction of a universe]]\nNarrator: So I decided to simulate a universe.\n[[Man is walking about his rocks, changing placement]]\nNarrator: The eons blur past as I walk down a single row.\n[[Zoom out of the rows of rocks]]\nNarrator: The rows blur past to compute a single step.\n[[Shows placement of two rocks]]\nNarrator: And in the simulation...\n[[The two rocks have moved; an after-image of their previous placement is present]]\nNarrator: ...another instant ticks by.\n[[Man #2 observes a mote of dust vanish]]\nNarrator: So if you see a mote of dust vanish from your vision in a little flash or something\n[[Man is rearranging rocks]]\nNarrator: I'm sorry.
