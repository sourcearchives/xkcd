Layered on top of these arrows, pointing up and down at the cross section, are a larger arrow below and a smaller arrow above.]]\n((This panel just contains text, and has a speech curlique hanging towards the person in the next panel.))\nTeacher: So, kids, the air above the wing travels a longer distance, so it has to go faster to keep up.  Faster air exerts less pressure, so the wing is lifted upward.\n\nStudent: But then why can planes fly upside down?\n\n((The teacher is standing, pondering the question.  Three arrows point out of this panel, leading to each of the next three panels which are arranged vertically.))\n\n((This is a label at the top of the panel, not a character speaking.))\nRight: \n((This is the character speaking.))\nTeacher: Wow, good question!  Maybe this picture is simplified -- or wrong!  We should learn more.\n\nWrong:\nTeacher: It's... complicated.\nTeacher: And we need to move on.\n\nVery wrong:\nTeacher: Santa Claus is your parents.\n\n{{Title text: This is a fun explanation to prepare your kids for; it's common and totally wrong. Good lines include 'why does the air have to travel on both sides at the same time?' and 'I saw the Wright brothers plane and those wings were curved the same on the top and bottom!'}}","alt":"This is a fun explanation to prepare your kids for; it's common and totally wrong.
