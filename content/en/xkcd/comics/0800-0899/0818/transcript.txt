Randall: Hey, everyone--
Randall: As I mentioned on the blag, I'm going through a rough time right now. I'm dealing with a serious family illness and it's become pretty overwhelming.
Randall: We're still getting a handle on everything, and I appreciate your patience while we figure it all out.

Randall: I like drawing, and might find time for it in the coming weeks, but I'm not going to push myself to stick to a schedule.
Randall: However, between my stacks of notebooks, scanner, and supportive sysadmin, I should at least have something interesting to share with yyou in this space each M
