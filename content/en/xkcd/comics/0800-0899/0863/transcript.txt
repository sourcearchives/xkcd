[[Student before a professor]]
Student: How can I pick a major? I'm interested in everything! Can't I major in "the universe"?

Professor: Okay. First, I'll need papers on every European trade summit that did not result in an agreement. Then, spend a year memorizing every microprocessor instruction set ever used in a production chip.

[[Student scratches head]]

Student:What I meat was I just want to read Malcolm Gladwell books and drink.
Professor: We all do, sweetie.

{{Title text: I hear Steven Levitt is writing a book analyzing A.J. Jacobs' quest to spend a year reading everything Malcolm Gladwell ever wrote. The audiobook will be narrated by Robert Krulwich of Radiolab.}}
