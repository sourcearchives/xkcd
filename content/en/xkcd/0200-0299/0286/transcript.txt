Girl: What's with the All Your Base stuff? Didn't that die like five years ago?
[[From off-panel]] : Yes.
[[Man enters panel]]
Man: It was my first internet meme, and my favorite.  Others tired of it, but I never did.
Man: So I wait.
Man: Someday, decades from now, people will have forgotten. It will be fresh again.
Man: Retro.

Girl: You need a hobby or something.
Man: What you say!!
Man: Wait, too soon.
