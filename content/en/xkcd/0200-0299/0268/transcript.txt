[[A girl is walking towards the right of the panel.]]
[[A boy wearing a backpack is walking towards the left of the panel.]]
[[They walk past each other.]]
[[The girl has a sudden thought.]]
[[The girl turns back and says.]]
Girl: Hi.
Boy: Uh, hi.
Girl: Sorry if this is weird, but
Girl: Do you like flying kites?
