[[Man and woman seated on couch watching a TV.]]
Woman: Argh, movie pet peeve. Someone sitting at a computer in the dark with the screen projected on their face. Monitors don't work like that!
[[Man and woman face each other on couch.]]
Man: Right - that only happens if you're in the way of a proected image. Like when we're sitting together in a parked car in the rain and the mottled light through the raindrops on the windshield makes shifting shadows on your skin...
[[Woman stands, man uses laptop on table behind couch.]]
Woman: ...I wasn't really into the movie anyway.
Man: The nearest rainstorm's about 60 miles away.
Woman: We'll drive fast.
Man: I'll grab some snacks.
{{title text: Out in a field, not another car for miles, silence but for the rain drumming on the sunroof, warm thick folds of the blanket hiding wordless fingertip games...}}
