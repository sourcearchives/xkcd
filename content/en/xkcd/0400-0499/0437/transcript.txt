My Hobby:
Renting an SUV and confusing the hell out of hybrid owners
[[A man is pumping gas into a Prius at a gas station. The prices can be seen in the background, and read:]]
$4.08
M: $4.38
P: $4.51
D: $4.85
[[Another man drives up alongside in an SUV and leans out the window]]
SUV Driver: Check out those prices! Your Prius ain't looking so smart now, huh?
Prius Driver: It's ... wait, what?
SUV Driver: Maybe you'll go green next time, asshole!
