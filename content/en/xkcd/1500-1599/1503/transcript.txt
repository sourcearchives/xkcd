((A squirrel ASTRONAUT is suspended in some kind of harness beneath a child's helium balloon. Two other squirrels serve as its GROUND TEAM.))

Ground team: Once you've chewed a hole in the sun, shoot the balloon to fall back to earth, then pull the parachute ripcord to land.
Astronaut: Are you SURE it's full of acorns?
Ground team: Look how bright and magnificent is is! What ELSE could be in there?

{{Title text: [Halfway to the Sun ...] Heyyyy ... what if this BALLOON is full of acorns?!}}
