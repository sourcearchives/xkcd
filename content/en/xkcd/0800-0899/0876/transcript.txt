[[Person is on the phone.]]
Person: Hello? 911? I'm trapped!
Person: It's dark and I can't see anything except these two distorted splotches of light!
Person: Help!

[[The 911 operator is in an office, wearing a headset.]]
Operator: Splotches of light? Your ... eyeballs?
Person (over phone): I think that's what they are! There's meat everywhere!

Operator: ... so you're a brain.
Person (over phone): Yes!
Operator: Yeah, we all are. You're not trapped. Use your body to walk around and experience reality.

Person: But everything's just signals in my sensory cortices! How can I be sure they correspond to an external world?!
Operator (over phone): I'm sorry, but we can't send a search-and-rescue team into Plato's cave.
