[[Three kids are in a living room. Furniture and other things are knocked over, broken, or tilted. The first kid is holding a handle of a plunger with cables goin offscreen.]]
First Kid: I've dynamited a trench through the kitchen to divert flow!
<<BOOM>>
[[The second kid is aiming a hose at the floor.]]
Second Kid: More hoses! We need to cool and solidify the surface layer!
<<FWOOSH>>
[[The third kid is standing on a chair, using a cell phone or radio.]]
Third Kid: Where are the damn helicopters?
Like many kids, we sometimes pretended the floor was lava.

{{Title text: We once got grounded when we convinced the FAA to block flights through our county because of ash clouds.}}
