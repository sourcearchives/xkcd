[[There is an airport security checkpoint where a queue of ten passengers is waiting to go through a backscatter x-ray scanner. Near the back of the line, Hat Guy is standing next to a stand which says "Viagra 
 $20". One passenger next to him is drinking a glass of water; another is contemplating the sign.]]
Security Guard (thinking): Oh god.

{{Title text: Don't need any, thanks. I have a backscattering fetish.}}
