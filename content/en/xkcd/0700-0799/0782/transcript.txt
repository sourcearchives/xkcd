[[A woman runs up to a man.]]
Woman: Rob! Rob!
Man: You look terrified! What's wrong?
Woman: We've made a huge mistake!

[[The woman and man stand facing each other.]]
Woman: Remember last week when we dug up all those Indian bones and made puppets out of them?
Man: Sure...

[[The woman holds her arms out for emphasis, the man puts his hands to his face in horror.]]
Woman: It turns out they were buried over an 
ancient Indian burial ground!

Man: 
Oh my God!
