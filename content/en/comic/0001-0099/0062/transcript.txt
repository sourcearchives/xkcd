[[squiggly heart design]]
You make me feel so
much it all runs together
I wish I could tell you
[[crisscrossing heart design]]
So few words
for so many feelings
crisscrossing my heart
[[heart matrix design]]
A matrix of desire
Tangled relations
I can't simplify
[[Karnaugh map of hearts]]
I wish I could find
the Karnaugh map
for love.
{{Love and circuit analysis, hand in hand at last.}}
