[[An unusually realistic (for xkcd) pencil drawing of Robert Smith's head and face, with a caption underneath.]]
Caption: Robert Smith should do a cover of Coldplay's 'Clocks,' so when he sings "Am I part of the cure 
 or am I part of the disease?" we can say, "Ooh, we know this one!"
{{Title Text: My first try at drawing a real face in years.}}
