Behind him is a house with a lawn.]]\nGuy's thoughts: I love the time just before sunrise. It's quiet; no one is ever just walking about. It's like a secret. I always hope that I'll find someone else quietly hiding from sleep, and we'll see each other and sit and talk. I guess this is a bad place to meet people. I wish it weren't.\n[[Guy goes into the house, brushes his teeth, and leaves the house again.]]\n[[Guy is at a club, disco balls in the ceiling and a giant woofer. Many people are dancing around him.]]\n{{Title Text: Sometimes, I sit on top of parking decks and watch the sun rise.  I feel like I should have a guitar or something.}}","year":"2006"}
