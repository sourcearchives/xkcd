This one is mostly by my little brother, Doug.
[[Person on a tall pillar is talking to person on the group]]
Person on pillar: The sky is so blue, and all the leaves are green.
Person on ground: Haven' t you ever wondered if we really see the same colors as everyone else? It's all perception.
Person on pillar: Well, you might as well call into question all of human experience. Who really knows what world someone else sees?
Person on ground: Yeah, I guess.
Person on pillar: Anyway, can you help me down from this pole?
Person on ground: What pole?
