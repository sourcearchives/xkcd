First Guy: Man, she's hot
Second Guy: Whatever, you are so gay.
First Guy: C'mon, everyone knows you're the gay one
Second Guy: Hey, your mom's pretty masculine, but sleeping with her doesn't make me gay.
First Guy: Fag.
Second Guy: Ass pirate.
First Guy: Fudge packer
Second Guy: Cock jockey
First Guy: Cum dumpster.

First guy: Okay, seriously, are you gay? Because if you've been holding out on me, we're missing out.
Second guy: No, it's cool.
First guy: OK me neither.
